An HTML + CSS based game

Honey Pursuit is a simple game developed by using HTML markup and CSS styling code only. 

There are three bee characters in the game: the hero, called Johnny Bee Good, is in pursuit of his beloved one - Princess Honey Bee, who's been abducted by the evil killer bee named Beevil. During the pursuit our hero will have to try to collect as much as honey pots as possible with mouse over them. Although there is a honey counter, the whole honey thing is just for fun really :)

Johnny can be controlled with the mouse, and there aren't any other special things that have to be done, except for waiting for Beevil's power to decrease to zero, which happens in a few seconds. Then Johnny and the Princess reunite in a loving harmony... which is followed by an outro.
